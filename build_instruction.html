            <img src="assets/mb_preamp.jpeg" alt="MB-727 Pre-amp" class="placeholder-image">
            <p>Welcome, buddies! In today’s article, we’re going to build a studio-quality electret mic pre-amplifier
                that
                sounds awesome, it’ll rival professional studio microphones!</p>
            <p>What?? I know what you’re thinking: <strong>Building a mic preamp with a cheap ECM instead of an
                    expensive
                    condenser mic? </strong>" Aren’t there already tons of videos and diagrams showing how to build
                one?"</p>
            <p>Yes, it’s true preamp <a href="https://tinyurl.com/54zrym3x">circuits are all over the internet</a>
                But here’s the catch: most of them don’t
                deliver the professional-quality sound you’re hoping for. Even if the circuit works, the audio quality
                often includes excessive noise, distortion, or an unnatural tone.</p>
            <p>In my opinion, the problem isn’t the mic; it’s the design of the preamp circuit. Even a generic ECM mic
                that costs around 20 cents can sound great if the circuit is properly designed and optimized for it.
                That’s exactly what we’re going to do in this video: design a circuit that pushes the limits of what a
                cheap electret mic can do!</p>

            </div>

            <p>The reason most preamp circuits don’t meet expectations is that designing a good preamp isn’t as simple
                as throwing a few components together. It requires careful attention to detail and a deep understanding
                of analog electronics.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gain Calculation:</strong> Determine the required gain based on the microphone’s sensitivity
                    and the target output level (in our case line-in signal).</li>
                <li><strong>Impedance Matching:</strong> Ensure the circuit matches the impedance of the mic to avoid
                    signal loss or distortion (Pc line-in).</li>
                <li><strong>Analog Signal Processing:</strong> Handle the audio signal cleanly, without introducing
                    unnecessary noise or distortion.(Carefully choosen bias resistor and coupling capacitor)</li>
                <li><strong>Mic Output Calculation:</strong> Use the mic’s input sound pressure level (SPL) to calculate
                    its electrical output.</li>
                <li><strong>Gain deviation at certain frequencies for RC passive filter:</strong> Most commonly the gain
                    is decreases by -3dB.
                    (In our case it was -0.5dB @20Hz and -0.1dB @20Khz freq Response deviation)</li>
                <li><strong>Passive Filter Design & Calculations :</strong> Calculate the cutoff frequencies for
                    high-pass and low-pass
                    filters to shape the audio spectrum (In our case it was Hi-fi response means 20Hz and 20Khz)</li>

                <p>These are only a few of them. There are a lot of steps that remain in designing a fully featured
                    preamp. So I decided to create a specific datasheet that includes step- by-step calculations and
                    contains the appropriate formulas. I am currently working on it. </p>

        <section id="preamp-parameters">
            <h2>Mic Preamp Parameters</h2>
            <p>For this project, I’ve chosen a non-inverting op-amp configuration for the preamp. This configuration is
                ideal for amplifying low-level signals from a microphone while maintaining stability and low noise.</p>
            <p>The circuit also includes built-in high-pass and low-pass filters, which are essential for shaping the
                audio signal:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>High-Pass Filter:</strong> Cutoff frequency of 6.99Hz.</li>
                <li><strong>Low-Pass Filter:</strong> Cutoff frequency of 131kHz.</li>

        <section id="design-notes">
            <h2>Design Notes</h2>
            <p><strong>This circuit is designed to be operated at 5v</strong> (Use battery supply as possible that
                reduces the power noise that overall reduces the
                noise of the preamp)</p>
            <p> <strong>Note:</strong> Use low tolerance resistor and COG or tantalum capacitors as possible for this
                design.</p>

        <section id="mic-chosen">
            <h2>Choosing correct electret mic</h2>
            <p>As for the mic, I used a generic <strong>CZN-15E electret mic</strong>. It’s cheap, easy to find, and
                gets the job done.
                If you want to upgrade,
                pick any mic with these specs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sensitivity: -32 dB at 1 Pa (94 dB SPL) @ 1 kHz</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Standard Operating voltage: 4.5V</strong>
                    your preamp.</li>
                <li><strong>Current consumption: 0.5mA</strong>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>These parameters are usually specified in a microphone datasheet.</p>

        <section id="simulation">
            <h2>SPICE Simulation for the Preamp</h2>
            <img src="assets/Transient Response.png" alt="SPICE Simulation result" class="placeholder-image">
            <p>Before building the circuit, I simulated it in LTspice to verify its performance. Simulations help catch
                potential issues before building the actual hardware.</p>
            <p>In the simulation result, our preamp outputs 454mV (amplitude) or 321mV (RMS),
                which is a line-level signal that we expect from an input voltage of around 29.343mv calculated using
                mic sensitivity -32 (Wait, I am working on designing a complete datasheet that include all the
                calculation including this one.)

            <p>Of course, no preamp build is complete without a real-world test. I’ll connect the preamp to the electret
                mic and record audio samples with a distance of 50cm from mic to audio source. This will give you a
                clear idea of how the circuit performs and what kind
                of audio quality you can expect.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="connecting-to-pc">
            <h2>Connecting the Preamp to a PC (Line-In Port)</h2>
            <img src="assets/line-in_port_in_pc.jpeg" alt="Line-in port on pc" class="placeholder-image">
            <p>Here’s a quick but important note: do NOT connect the output of this preamp to your PC’s mic input.
                Instead, connect it to the line-in port. This setup ensures you get the best sound quality without
                distortion or noise.</p>
            <p>
                To connect the preamp’s output to a device like your PC or recorder, you’ll need a <strong>3.5mm TRS
                    cable</strong>. Since our circuit is mono, we’ll only use the <strong>Tip</strong> and
                <strong>Sleeve</strong> connections, while the <strong>Ring</strong> will remain unconnected. Here’s how
                it works:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tip (Left Channel):</strong> Connect the <em>Tip</em> of the TRS cable to the
                    <em>output</em> of your preamp. This carries the audio signal from the circuit.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Sleeve (Ground):</strong> Connect the <em>Sleeve</em> to the <em>ground</em> of your preamp
                    circuit. This ensures proper grounding and minimizes noise.</li>
                <li><strong>Ring (Right Channel):</strong> Since this is a mono circuit, the <em>Ring</em> will not be
                    connected. This is perfectly fine as the mono signal will still work properly with most devices,
                    which automatically route the mono signal to both left and right channels.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Using a TRS cable ensures compatibility with standard audio devices, like the line-in port on a PC or an
                external recorder. Plus, it provides a clean and professional connection for your project.
